Microcontroller: Rpi3
Requirements: Jumper wires, Breadboard, LEDs
Sensors: Ultrasonic sensor, IR Sensor, MQ2 Gas sensor
Motor: Stepper Motor 

Stepper Motor: A stepper motor, also known as step motor or stepping motor, is a brushless DC electric motor that divides a full rotation into a number of equal steps. The motor's position can then be commanded to move and hold at one of these steps without any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop controller), as long as the motor is carefully sized to the application in respect to torque and speed.
